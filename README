This is the solution of famous machine learning problem taken from 
kaggle.com, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. The detail of 
this problem can be seen at:

I am solving this problem by using the google's machine learning library
called tensorflow. This is a crude implementation of tensorflow in this 
problem done as a part of my tensorflow learning. The accuracy of the 
trained model is about 82% in average and there are many possible ways 
to improve it.
